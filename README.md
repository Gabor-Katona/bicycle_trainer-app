# Bicycle Trainer Mobile Application

This repository contains a mobile application built with React Native framework that serves as a bicycle trainer. The application communicates with a Bluetooth-enabled sensor module installed on the bicycle, which is manufactured by Onsemi. With this application, users can track their cycling sessions, monitor their performance.
This project was developed as part of a university assignment for the subject "Tímový projekt" in FEI STU.

## Features

- Bluetooth Connectivity: The application establishes a Bluetooth connection with the Onsemi development board (BDK-GEVK) with sensor module (MULTI-SENSE-GEVB) to receive real-time data from the bicycle.
- Cycling Sessions: Users can start, pause, resume, and stop cycling sessions within the application.
- Data Analysis: The application stores cycling session data locally, allowing users to review and analyze their past performances.
- Map Integration: The application now includes a map feature that displays the path taken during cycling sessions. Users can view their route on a map within the app, providing a visual representation of their ride.
